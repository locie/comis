First version of the Fast Building Library, largely incomplete, only the heating part is correctly developed today as well as the fastModeling package

The library will includes in its final version all the energetic systems commonly encountered in building (heating, cooling, DHW, ventilation, ...) as well as the sensors and formulas necessary for their use in the framework of the COMIS project
