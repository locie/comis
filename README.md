First version of the Fast Building Modeling Library, largely incomplete, only the heating/DHW part is partly developed today as well as the ElementaryBlocks package

The library will includes in its final version all the energetic systems commonly encountered in building (heating, cooling, DHW, ventilation, ...) as well as the sensors and formulas necessary for their use in the framework of the COMIS project

The library is systems oriented and the need of a library for components is required.
The current version works with the Buildings library from Berkeley. All requirements from the IDEAS library are already imported and adapted for the a compatibility with other Buildings's component.
Further version will be compatible with the Annex 60 library
