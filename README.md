First version of the Fast Building Modeling Library, largely incomplete, only the heating/DHW section is partly developed today as well as the ElementaryBlocks package. Take a look on the support website for some tutorials or help : https://locie.github.io/comis/

The library will includes in its final version all the energetic systems encountered along the COMIS project (heating, cooling, DHW, ventilation, ...) as well as the sensors and formulas necessary for their use in the framework of the COMIS project

The library is systems oriented and a library of components is required.
The current version works with the Buildings library https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings. All requirements from the IDEAS library are already imported and adapted for the a compatibility with other Buildings's component.
Further version will be compatible with the Annex 60 library

This librairy is freely available and was used in the COMIS project sponsorized by the ANR. The librairy doesn't represent a huge enhancement of already available ones but can complement and accelerate their use in whole building modeling
