>  [SALib](https://github.com/SALib/SALib)

**Sensitivity Analysis Library** in Python (Numpy). Contains Sobol, Morris, and FAST methods. Used to find influencial parameters for error propagation and models calibration.

>[DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)

**DEAP** is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. DEAP contains Genetic algorithm, Evolution strategies algorithm, Multi-objective optimisation ...

> [pyDOE](https://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE/)

**pyDOE** is designed to help the scientist, engineer, statistician, etc., to construct appropriate experimental designs. It contains Factorial Designs, Response Surface Designs and Randomizad Designs facilities

> [BuildingSpy](https://github.com/lbl-srg/BuildingsPy)

**BuildingSpy** is a interface between Python and Dymola. The package contains functions to extract data series from the output file of a Dymola simulation for further use. See the [Buildingspy website](http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/buildingspy/) for more information
