> Instrumentation is a collective term for measuring instruments used for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities, and has its origins in the art and science of Scientific instrument-making.

# The monitoring standard ?
<p align="justify">
The COMIS project is found by the <a href="http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/">French National Agency for the Research (ANR)</a>. That's why our monitoring standard is the french national standard defined in the <strong>L’instrumentation Des Bâtiments</strong> report <i>(Buildings Monitoring report)</i>. Otherwise you can used any standard wich defined accuratly the kind of sensors the most used in buildings operation associate with there errors of measurement

<p align="justify"> The list is mostly partial and don't hesitate to contact me if french langage is a barrier for you. In addition, the accuracy of sensors is given in a raw value but most of the accuracy sensors are relative to a temperature, volume or size, ... To obatain a more precise error formula, please refer to the (COSTIC 2015) report </p>

<p align="justify">
In order to implement quickly as possible the sensors required for the commissionning phase a database was created. For more details on how to use this tool, you can going on the dedicated section.
