## The COMIS Project Resumy

<p align="justify">The COMIS project aims at developing a new method for  <strong> evaluating the efficiency of innovative systems in energy-efficient buildings  </strong>, through an original commissioning approach focused on the first year of a building's operation, which is often particularly critical in terms of fine-tuning the active systems operation parameters in the building.</p>

<p align="justify"> The proposed commissioning approach is based on <strong> measurements </strong> and <strong> numerical simulations </strong>, and combines a virtual comparison of the considered system's actual operating conditions to theoretical "ideal" operating conditions and to a conventional reference system.</p>

<p align="justify"> The proposed methodology will be developed in 3 main steps. <strong> The first step aims at measuring the operating characteristics of the considered systems</strong>, in their respective operating environments. One of the important aspects in this field is the choice of the adequate metrology,regarding the identification of the physical parameters relative to the considered systems, the indoor conditions, and the building's usage. The developed methodology will rely on statistical procedures such as "sensitivity analysis" or "principal component analysis", in order to choose the appropriate spatial granularity and acquisition frequency for the instrumentation to be installed. Then, even before being used for the model parameters identification in the numerical simulations, <strong>the acquired measurement data need to be filtered, corrected, possibly rebuilt, and finally aggregated into high level indicators</strong>. For this purpose, a full set of data processing algorithms will be developed. These algorithms will be adapted to the nature of the measured physical parameters and to the acquisition devices used.</p>

<p align="justify">Once the system's operating conditions and parameters have been characterized in the used building, based on the measured and processed data, <strong>the next step is to evaluate its performance against the expected theoretical performance</strong>, which is estimated from the actual weather conditions, envelope measured characteristics and real usage of the building. For this the theoretical "ideal" operating conditions of the system have to be defined, considering its internal parameters and the expected service. A behavioral model of each considered system will be developed, and their parameters will be identified from
the actual measurement data acquired in the building. These behavioral models will be used to identify the parameters of the theoretical "ideal" operating conditions, defined either in terms of sizing (of its internal elements) or command and control (of each element regarding the other ones).</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>The third step is about the reliability of the developed models and performance indicators used in the project.</strong> Their will be assessed by characterizing the influence of models input parameters uncertainties on models output results. In addition to the "ideal" operating conditions approach, the observed system will be compared to a conventional reference solution providing an identical service under identical conditions (weather, usage, building envelope intrinsic performance). The aim of this complementary approach is to assess that the rightful choice has been made during the conception phase, regarding the expected service and original choice criteria. As a final step, the COMIS project will include the study of four new or newly renovated buildings displaying
ambitious energy performance targets (low consumption, passive or positive energy labels) and including innovative heating, cooling, ventilation, DHW production and management systems. The developed commissioning methodology will be implemented, tested, improved and eventually validated on these test cases.</p>
